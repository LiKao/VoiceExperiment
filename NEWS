* Simplified structure of arguments for combined functions
* Major speed improvement

VoiceExperiment v0.2.0 (Release date: 2016-04-03)
==============

Changes:
* Corrected distribution of manual when installing from github
* Switched license to GPL-v3
* Switched to hanning window as default window (better resolution)
* FIX: Error in parameter propagation from directory analysis function
* FIX: Representation of stereo files
* Additional tests
* Added normalization of energy levels
* Added limit of onsets based on absolute energy

Notes:

The Hanning window now used, because the drop off towards the ends of
the window provides much better resolution with overlapping windows.
The drop off makes the window focus on the middle of the window. If
this is not desired (or the windows do not overlapp), the original
boxcar window can be selected using a parameter.

Onset detection now based on absolute values by default, instead of
percentiles. Onset detection based on relative values is unreliable,
if most of the file is silence, since then the percentiles are mostly
used for very silent data.

If absolute onset is combined with normalization (i.e. default case),
the onset will be detected relative to the maximum energy in the file.

Known issues:

* In presence of ground loops, the resulting waves may create additional
  onsets

* Detection of offsets is unreliable due to slow fading of signals
